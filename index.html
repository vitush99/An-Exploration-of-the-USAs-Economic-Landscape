            <p>
                Did you know that if California were a country, its economy would rank as the 5th largest in the world, surpassing nations like the United Kingdom and India? 
                This remarkable fact highlights the vast economic diversity within the United States, where each state contributes uniquely to the nation’s overall economic landscape. 
                This project aims to demystify complex economic indicators such as household income, employment rates, and GDP per capita through engaging visualizations and interactive tools. 
                By combining data with dynamic visualizations, this project offers an intuitive way to explore how these indicators vary across states and over time. Whether you're curious about 
                income disparities, unemployment trends, or the economic growth of individual states, this explorable explanation will guide you through the data in a way that's both accessible 
                and insightful. Make sure to check out our demo video below to get a better idea of how to use our visualizations.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The economy of the United States is incredibly diverse, with each state contributing uniquely to the nation's overall economic health.
                From vibrant urban hubs with concentrated wealth to rural regions defined by specific industries, the economic landscape varies dramatically.
                These differences are driven by factors such as population size, income distribution, labor market engagement, and wealth concentration. 
                To truly grasp the complexities of the U.S. economy, it’s essential to break some of these metrics down.
            </p>
            <h2>Explore Household Income</h2>
            <p>
                Household income is a critical indicator of economic well-being, reflecting both individual earning potential and the broader socio-economic factors 
                influencing families and individuals. The composition of a household—whether it’s a family with dual incomes, a single-parent household, or an 
                individual living alone—plays a significant role in shaping income levels. By analyzing household income across different categories, we can 
                uncover patterns of economic opportunity, disparities, and resilience, offering a window into the diverse financial realities faced by Americans. 
            </p>
            </p>
                Use the visualization below to compare head to head houshold incomes and compare between the years 2022 and 2023. When checking "Plot All Categories", 
                you can hover over the bars to see which bar is associated to which category. But, make sure to uncheck "Plot All Categories" if you want to compare head to head!

            <section id="section-2-explanation">
                </p>
                    <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html">Source: United States Census Bureau</a>

                <p>

                    Household median income is very different, depending on the household type and reflects a larger socio-economic dynamic within the United States. 
                    In general, a family household with a married couple at its head consistently shows the highest median income levels. Much of this likely comes from 
                    a dual-income advantage. By contrast, single-income households, especially those maintained by a single female or male householder with no 
                    spouse present, notably lower medians. Such a wide gap in income between family and non-family households indicates the economic struggle of 
                    single-parent families due to various systemic factors, including the pay gap between genders and the limited availability of affordable childcare.
                </p>
                    Non-family households, including those maintained by a single individual, also have significantly lower median incomes compared to 
                    family households. These figures point toward the economic vulnerability of individuals living alone or without familial supporting structures. 
                    Furthermore, when viewed across years 2022 and 2023, any observed change in median income across these categories could reflect broader economic 
                    trends such as inflation, wage growth, or post-pandemic recovery.
                </p>
                </p>
                    In all, this visualization shows that understanding household composition is crucial for analyzing income inequality. As such, targeted policy 
                    interventions are warranted to support single-parent families and reduce wage disparities in order to decrease economic inequities and promote 
                    financial resiliency among all household types.

        <h2>Exploring Incomes by Age Groups</h2>
        <p>
            Income levels are closely tied to an individual’s age, reflecting the progression of careers, educational attainment, and retirement. Understanding 
            these trends reveals not only the earning potential across different stages of life but also the economic challenges and opportunities faced by 
            specific age groups. This section provides an interactive visualization that explores median income across age categories, offering insights into 
            how income evolves from early adulthood to retirement.
        </p>
        </p>
            Just like before, you can compare between years and now compare between age groups head to head.

        <p>
            After playing around with the visual, you may realize that there is a relationship between median income and age. 
            This relationship allows us to better understand the life cycle of an individual's career. Income increases through 
            early adulthood and peaks during the 35-54 age range before starting to decline. This happens to correspond with what is traditionally 
            considered the prime working years where workers gain experience, often complete higher education or specialized skill training, 
            and advance in their careers. Skilled professional capital will have built up over time, and the possibility of higher earnings is realized
            more in these middle parts of life.
        </p>
        </p>
            On the other hand, the 15-24 age bracket has the smallest median income. This difference is explained by the high number of part-time and 
            entry-level jobs in this age category because many are still in school or just starting their work careers. Paralleling that, the decrease 
            in median income across the age 65-and-over group represents their movement into the retired stage of life when they would be dependent 
            mostly on fixed incomes, like pensions or Social Security, rather than active wages.
        </p>
        </p>
            The income plateau and subsequent decline beyond age 55 give rise to important considerations of economic security in older age. This 
            finding underlines the importance of ample retirement savings and social support to ensure economic security in later life. It also may 
            be informative to compare the 2022 and 2023 age-income distributions for evidence of how economic conditions (inflation and/or 
            labor market changes) affect different age groups over time.

            <h2>Comparing States</h2>
            <p>
                The economic story of the United States is shaped by the unique contributions of its individual states. Each state plays a distinct role in the nation’s overall economy. Understanding these contributions requires 
                delving into key indicators like employment levels, unemployment rates, and workforce distribution. This section provides a detailed 
                exploration of state-level economic dynamics, highlighting both the strengths and challenges across the nation. By examining interactive 
                maps, you’ll gain insights into how different states contribute to the labor market and how regional disparities influence economic 
                opportunities.
            </p>

            <h2>Unemployment Rates Across the United States</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s dive into the unemployment rates across the U.S.! The heat map below shows how unemployment varies from state to state, giving us a clear picture of 
                where people are struggling the most to find jobs. Darker shades mean higher unemployment, while lighter ones show lower rates. It’s interesting to see such 
                big differences, with rates ranging from as low as 2.0% to over 5.3%. Don’t forget to hover over each state to see how the percentages shift between 2023 
                and 2024; Zoom out to catch Alaska and Puerto Rico!

            </p>
            <p>
                When you hover over each state, you might notice something interesting: unemployment rates have been climbing since 2023. So, what’s going on here? Well, 
                part of it is that more people are returning to the workforce after taking a break since 2021(post Covid-19), which naturally increases the labor supply. 
                But there’s another big factor at play: the rise of AI. AI has been advancing so quickly in recent years and has excelled in automating repetitive, 
                predictable tasks. Jobs that used to require humans are now being done more efficiently by machines, which means fewer people are needed for the same 
                amount of work. And in some cases, AI is making certain jobs completely obsolete.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have also noticed that states like Nebraska and Utah boast the lowest unemployment rates. These states often have diverse economies and 
                fewer people, which can make it easier to keep unemployment low. On the flip side, states in the South and parts of the West Coast tend to have higher 
                unemployment. This might be because of challenges like job losses in specific industries, higher living costs, or fewer job opportunities in rural or 
                struggling areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that stands out is how much regional policies and industries impact employment. For example, states relying heavily on tourism or oil production 
                can face big swings when demand drops or unexpected events happen. Meanwhile, neighboring states might have totally different unemployment rates, which 
                often comes down to differences in local leadership, education systems, or infrastructure investments.
            </p>
            <p>
                This map is a call to action: smarter economic policies and workforce programs are needed to create equal job opportunities and 
                tackle the disparities we see across the country.

            <h2>Employed Numbers Across the United States</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s take a closer look at employment numbers across the United States! This viusalization shows the raw numbers of total employment across the country in 2024. 
                You can hover over each state to see the net change and percentage change in employment over the past 12 months. Don't forget to zoom out to catch Alaska and Puerto Rico!

            </p>
            <p>
                This visualization gives us a bird’s-eye view of where people are working and how the workforce is distributed by state. Unsurprisingly, states 
                with larger populations like California, Texas, and New York dominate the numbers—they’re the heavyweights of the national economy. 
                Meanwhile, smaller states in the Midwest and Mountain West have fewer people overall, which naturally means smaller workforces. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What’s really fascinating is how urban and industrial centers play such a big role in shaping these numbers. Places like Chicago in Illinois 
                or Miami in Florida tend to cluster at the higher end of the employment spectrum, thanks to the economic power of urbanization. But it’s 
                important to remember: these figures show the number of jobs, not necessarily the quality of those jobs. Things like wage levels and job 
                stability can vary a lot, even within the same state.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, let’s compare this with the unemployment map. You might spot some interesting patterns. For instance, even though California has a massive 
                workforce, it can still struggle with high unemployment. This could mean there are mismatches between the jobs available and the people looking 
                for work, or maybe not everyone has equal access to those jobs. On the flip side, states like Nebraska or South Dakota might have fewer jobs overall,
                 but their labor markets are tight, meaning most people who want to work are already employed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This visualization really shows the complexity of labor dynamics in the U.S. Employment volume doesn’t always equal economic health—it’s more nuanced 
                than that. By looking at these maps together, we can see where targeted policies could make the biggest impact, whether it’s creating new opportunities 
                in struggling areas or addressing mismatches in places with high unemployment. It’s a story of challenges and opportunities, all told through the data.

            <h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross State Product (GSP)</h2>
            <p>
                The economy is a massive and complex system, but two key indicators help us understand its performance: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) at the national level and 
                GSP (Gross State Product) at the state level. Together, they offer a way to measure economic activity, compare growth, and identify disparities both within and 
                across states. This section breaks down these concepts, highlights their differences, and explains their significance in painting a picture of the U.S. economy.
            </p>
            <h3>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> GDP measures the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period, usually annually or quarterly.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> National level (e.g., the entire United States).</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides a snapshot of the overall economic health of a country.</li>
                        <li>Used for comparing the economic performance of different countries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consumption:</strong> Spending by households.</li>
                        <li><strong>Investment:</strong> Spending on capital goods like machinery, buildings, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Government Expenditures:</strong> Government spending on goods and services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Net Exports:</strong> Exports minus imports.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The GDP of the United States in 2024 is approximately $28.78 trillion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gross State Product (GSP)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> GSP measures the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a specific state in a 
                    given period. It is the state-level equivalent of GDP, measuring economic performance at a sub-national level.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> State level (e.g., California, Texas).</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reflects the economic contribution of individual states to the national economy.</li>
                        <li>Useful for comparing the economic performance of different states within the same country.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Same as GDP, but limited to a single state’s economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Texas’s GSP in 2023 is approximately $2.6 trillion.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In essence, GSP is to a state what GDP is to a country. If you are analyzing economic data for individual states within a country 
                (like the United States), the term GSP is appropriate. However, when referring to the aggregated economic performance of the 
                entire country, you use GDP.

            <p>
                Did you lock in your guess? If you read the introduction you might have already known the answer. California's GDP in 2023 was $3,870,378.9, 
                which was 14% of the national GDP of $27.7 trillion. This made California the largest economy in the United States, with Texas and New York 
                following in second and third place.
            <p>
            <p>
                The steady rise of larger states California, Texas, and New York shows how broad and extensive industries drive economic output at the state level.
                The visualization also captures periods of economic fluctuation, including the slowdown of 2008 during the financial crisis when so many states 
                saw their economies stagnate or dip. We can also see a noticeable dip in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic. The post-crisis recoveries are observed, 
                resuming upward growth trends across different states at different rates. Some states with a more diversified industrial base generally perform in a much 
                steadier manner, whereas some relying on specific sectors—energy or manufacturing, for instance—are more volatile.

                Lastly, let's take a journey through the global economic landscape and see how the United States compares to other countries in terms of GDP. 
                The visualization below highlights the top 10 countries by GDP from the year 2000 through to the beginning of 2025 (end of 2024). Using the slider, you can move in

            </p>
            <p>
                As you move the slider through the years, one thing becomes immediately clear: the United States is a titan in the global economy. Its dominance 
                is represented by the sheer size of its bubble, often towering above others. This reflects its robust industries, from technology and finance to 
                entertainment and manufacturing, along with its unmatched ability to attract talent and investment worldwide. It’s no wonder the U.S. has consistently 
                been at the top of the rankings.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it’s not just the U.S. that has a compelling story. Let’s see how other countries in the top 10 compare to the U.S.:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>China:</strong> Its growth is one of the most remarkable stories of modern history. From 2000 onwards, its GDP grows at an extraordinary rate, 
                    reflecting the country’s rapid industrialization, export-driven economy, and population size. By the end of 2024, it solidifies its place as the second-largest economy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Japan:</strong> While its economy is more stable and less volatile, Japan remains in the top 10 due to its advanced industries and technological 
                    innovations. Its GDP growth is slower compared to some, but its resilience speaks volumes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Germany:</strong> As the economic powerhouse of Europe, Germany’s bubble is a consistent presence in the rankings. Its expertise in engineering, 
                    particularly in the automotive sector, keeps it competitive year after year.
                </li>

                    <strong>India:</strong> Starting as a smaller player in the early 2000s, India’s GDP grows steadily, driven by its burgeoning tech industry, population, 
                    and services sector. By end of 2024, its bubble represents the strides made in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

                <li>
                    <strong>United Kingdom and France:</strong> These countries maintain strong GDP figures due to their established industries, including finance, 
                    fashion, and tourism. They represent stability in a rapidly changing global economy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Brazil:</strong> Brazil’s bubble may shrink and expand slightly, but its presence is due to its rich natural resources, agriculture, and 
                    growing industrial base.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Canada:</strong> With a smaller population but vast natural resources, Canada holds its ground as a top economy. Its stable financial 
                    systems and trade relations with the U.S. help it stay competitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>South Korea:</strong> Known for its tech giants like Samsung and LG, South Korea punches above its weight with its innovation-driven 
                    economy and strong export markets.

                Each bubble tells its own story. While the United States remains a steady and dominant force, the rise of countries like China and India showcases the 
                shift in global economic power towards Asia. The resilience of countries like Japan, Germany, and South Korea highlights the importance of innovation and 
                adaptability. Meanwhile, resource-rich nations like Brazil and Canada show how natural wealth can fuel consistent growth.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                If there’s one big takeaway from this project, it’s just how diverse and complex the U.S. economic landscape really is. By looking at different states and 
                their contributions to GDP, we see not only massive growth from powerhouses like California, Texas, and New York but also stark contrasts in income distribution, 
                employment rates, and regional dynamics. It’s a story of both opportunities and challenges that define the nation’s economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project stands out because:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It’s interactive:</strong> You get to dive into the data yourself, exploring things like income trends and GSP changes over time, making the insights 
                        feel personal and meaningful.</li>
                    <li><strong>It’s clear:</strong> The visualizations are designed to be simple and intuitive, so even if you’re not a data expert, you can quickly understand the 
                        key takeaways.</li>
                    <li><strong>It tells a story:</strong> Each section ties the data to real-world impacts, helping you connect the numbers to the lived experiences of people across 
                        the country.</li>
                    <li><strong>It’s comprehensive:</strong> By bringing together household income, employment rates, age-based earnings, and GDP, the project gives a full picture of 
                        how different pieces of the economy fit together.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day, this project is about showing how understanding economic trends—both nationally and at the state level—can help address systemic issues and build 
                a more equitable future. The combination of interactive tools and thoughtful analysis makes these important topics accessible and engaging while hopefully leaving you with 
                a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the U.S. economy.
