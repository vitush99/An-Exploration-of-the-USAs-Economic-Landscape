            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that if California were a country, its economy would rank as the 5th largest in the world, surpassing nations like the United Kingdom and India? 
                This remarkable fact highlights the vast economic diversity within the United States, where each state contributes uniquely to the nation’s overall economic landscape. 
                This project aims to demystify complex economic indicators—such as household income, employment rates, and GDP per capita—through engaging visualizations and interactive tools. 
                By combining data with dynamic visualizations, this project offers an intuitive way to explore how these indicators vary across states and over time. Whether you're curious about 
                income disparities, unemployment trends, or the economic growth of individual states, this explorable explanation will guide you through the data in a way that's both accessible 
                and insightful. Make sure to check out our demo video below to get a better idea of how to use our visualizations.

            <p>
                The economy of the United States is incredible diverse, with each state contributing uniquely to the nation's overall economic health.
                From vibrant urban hubs with concentrated wealth to rural regions defined by specific industries, the economic landscape varies dramatically.
                These differences are driven by factors such as population size, income distribution, labor market engagement, and wealth concentration. 
                To truly grasp the complexities of the U.S. economy, it’s essential to break some of these metrics down.

                Each metric in the dropdown menu represents a unique aspect of economic activity. For instance, Total Population (npopult992) highlights 
                the size of a state’s population, serving as a baseline for understanding economic scale. Average Income Between Two Percentiles (afiinct992) 
                delves into income distribution, showcasing disparities within the population, while Total Value of All Wealth in a State (mfiinct992) reflects 
                the economic resources within a state, emphasizing regions with concentrated wealth.
            </p>
            </p>
                Other metrics further illuminate economic activity. Total Tax Reports Filed (ntaxret992) captures the formal economy's activity and serves as 
                a proxy for labor market engagement. Meanwhile, Proportion of Households With Single-Family Income (sfiinct992) underscores the structure and 
                income contributions of family households, and Proportion of State-Wide Income Contributed by Percentile Group (sptinct992) reveals income 
                inequality by highlighting how much income specific groups contribute.

            </p>
                This visualization allows users to toggle between these metrics, enabling them to explore state-specific trends and better understand the 
                diversity in economic landscapes across U.S. states. From population density and family income structures to income inequality and tax 
                engagement, the visualization ties demographic trends to economic activity. It lays the groundwork for deeper analyses of regional disparities 
                and provides a foundation for targeted policy discussions. The interactive nature ensures users can engage with the data in a meaningful way, 
                drawing insights tailored to their specific interests.

            <h2>Explore Household Income</h2>
            <p>
                Household income is a critical indicator of economic well-being, reflecting both individual earning potential and the broader socio-economic factors 
                influencing families and individuals. The composition of a household—whether it’s a family with dual incomes, a single-parent household, or an 
                individual living alone—plays a significant role in shaping income levels. By analyzing household income across different categories, we can 
                uncover patterns of economic opportunity, disparities, and resilience, offering a window into the diverse financial realities faced by Americans.

            <p>
                Household median income is very different, depending on the household type and reflects a larger socio-economic dynamic within the United States. 
                In general, a family household with a married couple at its head consistently shows the highest median income levels. Much of this likely comes from 
                a dual-income advantage. By contrast, single-income households-most especially those maintained by a single female or male householder with no 
                spouse-present notably lower medians. Such a wide gap in income between family and non-family households indicates the economic struggle of 
                single-parent families due to various systemic factors, including the pay gap between genders and the limited availability of affordable childcare.
            </p>
            </p>
                Non-family households, therefore, including those maintained by a single individual, also have significantly lower median incomes compared to 
                family households. These figures point toward the economic vulnerability of individuals living alone or without familial supporting structures. 
                Furthermore, when viewed across years-2022 and 2023-any observed change in median income across these categories could reflect broader economic 
                trends such as inflation, wage growth, or post-pandemic recovery. For example, even the minor increase in incomes for most types may point to 
                an incremental economic increase, although the continuing dispersion among household types indicates persisting structural inequity.
            </p>
            </p>
                In all, this visualization shows that understanding household composition is crucial for analyzing income inequality. As such, targeted policy 
                interventions are warranted to support single-parent families and reduce wage disparities in order to decrease economic inequities and promote 
                financial resiliency among all household types.

        <h2>Exploring Incomes by Age Groups</h2>
        <p>
            Income levels are closely tied to an individual’s age, reflecting the progression of careers, educational attainment, and retirement. Understanding 
            these trends reveals not only the earning potential across different stages of life but also the economic challenges and opportunities faced by 
            specific age groups. This section provides an interactive visualization that explores median income across age categories, offering insights into 
            how income evolves from early adulthood to retirement. By comparing age groups and tracking changes over time, we can better understand the economic realities of different generations and the broader implications for financial security and inequality.
        </p>
        </p>
            Just like before, you can compare between years and now compare between age groups head to head.

            There is a clear relationship between median income and age, reflecting the life cycle of an individual's career. Income increases through 
            early adulthood and peaks during the 35-54 age range before starting to decline. This happens to correspond with what is traditionally 
            considered the prime working years-the period when workers gain experience, often complete higher education or specialized skill training, 
            and advance in their careers. Skilled professional capital will have built up over time, and the possibility of higher earnings is realized
            more in these middle parts of life.
        </p>
        </p>
            On the other hand, the 15-24 age bracket has the smallest median income. This difference is explained by the high number of part-time and 
            entry-level jobs in this age category because many are still in school or just starting their work careers. Paralleling that, the decrease 
            in median income across the age 65-and-over group represents their movement into the retired stage of life when they would be dependent 
            mostly on fixed incomes, like pensions or Social Security, rather than active wages.
        </p>
        </p>
            The income plateau and subsequent decline beyond age 55 give rise to important considerations of economic security in older age. This 
            finding underlines the importance of ample retirement savings and social support to ensure economic security in later life. It also may 
            be informative to compare the 2022 and 2023 age-income distributions for evidence of how economic conditions-including inflation and/or 
            labor market changes-affect different age groups over time.
        </p>
        </p>
            This figure displays the interactions between age, career trajectory, and financial planning as a frame for considering life-span implications 
            of economic inequality.

            <h2>Comparing States</h2>
            <p>
                The economic story of the United States is shaped by the unique contributions of its individual states. Each state plays a distinct role in the nation’s overall economy. Understanding these contributions requires 
                delving into key indicators like employment levels, unemployment rates, and workforce distribution. This section provides a detailed 
                exploration of state-level economic dynamics, highlighting both the strengths and challenges across the nation. By examining interactive 
                maps, you’ll gain insights into how different states contribute to the labor market and how regional disparities influence economic 
                opportunities.

            <h2>Unemployment Rates Across the United States</h2>
            <p>
                The heat map below shows the distribution of unemployment rates across the United States and thus provides a geographic lens into the disparities 
                in economic fortunes. Darker shades represent states that have higher unemployment rates, while lighter shades show states that have 
                relatively lower rates. The scale of unemployment rates-from a low of 2.0% to well over 5.3%-indicate great variability in local economic 
                conditions, labor market dynamics, and policy impacts. Let us take a look at the United States map and explore each state. **Make sure to zoom out to see Alaska and Puerto Rico!
            </p>
            <div id="legend" style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: white; border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 200px;"></div>
            <div id="chart5" class="map-visualization"></div>
            <p>

                We can see that the lowest unemployment rates are in the Midwest and Mountain West states, such as Nebraska and Utah, which often reflect a mix of 
                diversified economies and lower population densities. In contrast, the highest unemployment rates are found in states of the South and parts of the 
                West Coast, which may reflect structural challenges such as industry-specific job losses, higher cost of living pressures, or restricted 
                access to employment opportunities in rural or economically depressed areas.
            <p>
            <p>
                This also brings out the contribution of regional policies and industries to employment. For example, states that depend on tourism or 
                oil production face fluctuations in demand and exogenous shocks. Further, variations among neighboring states also indicate that 
                local governance, educational systems, and infrastructure investments influence the characteristics of the labor market.
            <p>
            <p>
                Further investigation into either trends over time or more detailed demographic and industry-specific unemployment data could help 
                explain these patterns. As such, this map calls for action in the form of targeted economic interventions and workforce development 
                programs to address regional disparities and create more equitable opportunities across the nation.

            <h2>Employed Numbers Across the United States</h2>
            <p>
                Now let's compare with the total employment numberd across the United States! 
            </p>
            <div id="legend-employment" style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: white; border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 200px;"></div>
                
            <div id="employment-map" class="map-visualization"></div>
            <p>
                This visualization presents the absolute numbers of employment throughout the United States, in a way giving an overview of workforce 
                distribution by state. States with larger populations, like California, Texas, and New York, naturally show higher employment numbers, 
                reflecting their large contribution to the national economy. Less populous states, like those in the Midwest and Mountain West regions, 
                show lower absolute employment figures, consistent with their smaller labor forces.
            </p>
            </p>
                The geographic distribution of the numbers of employment also underlines the economic weight of the urban and industrial centers. Large
                 metropolitan states, such as Illinois with Chicago and Florida with Miami, tend to cluster in the higher ranges of employment, underlining 
                 the role of urbanization in creating jobs. These figures do not reflect employment quality, such as wage levels or job stability, which 
                 may vary widely within and across states.
            </p>
            </p>
                When juxtaposed against the unemployment rate map, some interesting patterns emerge. Highly employed states, such as California, may still 
                have a high unemployment rate, which would indicate labor supply and demand mismatches or regional job accessibility issues. On the other 
                hand, states with low unemployment rates and lower employment numbers, such as Nebraska or South Dakota, reflect tight labor markets in 
                smaller economies. These relationships underline the complexity in labor dynamics, where employment volume does not always guarantee low 
                unemployment.
            </p>
            </p>
                Together, these visualizations paint a detailed picture of the U.S. labor market, showing both its absolute workforce strength and 
                unemployment challenges. They underscore the tailored economic strategies needed to address regional disparities, support job creation, 
                and ensure equal access to available opportunities across the country.

            <p>
                In essence, GSP is to a state what GDP is to a country. If you are analyzing economic data for individual states within a country 
                (like the United States), the term GSP is appropriate. However, when referring to the aggregated economic performance of the 
                entire country, you use GDP.

                Did you lock in your guess? If you read the introduction you might have already known the answer. California's GDP in 2023 was $3,870,378.9, 
                which was 14% of the national GDP of $27.7 trillion. This made California the largest economy in the United States, with Texas and New York 
                following in second and third place.

            <p>
                The steady rise of larger states California, Texas, and New York shows how broad and extensive industries drive economic output at the state level.
                The visualization also captures periods of economic fluctuation, including the slowdown of 2008 during the financial crisis when so many states 
                saw their economies stagnate or dip. The post-crisis recoveries are observed, resuming upward growth trends across different states at different 
                rates. Some states with a more diversified industrial base generally perform in a much steadier manner, whereas some relying on specific sectors—energy 
                or manufacturing, for instance—are more volatile.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The key takeaway from this project is the profound diversity of the U.S. economic landscape and the critical need to examine multiple economic indicators to grasp its complexities. The visualizations demonstrate that while states like California, Texas, and New York drive national economic growth with their massive contributions to GDP, they also highlight stark disparities in income distribution, employment rates, and regional economic dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project succeeds in explaining these insights because of its:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Users can explore economic data tailored to their interests, from comparing income distributions to visualizing state-specific GSP over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> The thoughtfully designed visualizations ensure accessibility, enabling even non-experts to grasp complex economic concepts effortlessly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contextual Narratives:</strong> Accompanying explanations connect data trends to real-world implications, fostering a deeper understanding of economic inequality and resilience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> By integrating diverse metrics—household income, age-based earnings, employment rates, and GDP—the project paints a comprehensive picture of the U.S. economy.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, this project demonstrates that understanding economic trends at both national and state levels is crucial for addressing systemic disparities and crafting policies that promote equitable growth. The combination of engaging visualizations and insightful analysis ensures that these critical issues are communicated effectively, leaving a lasting impression on viewers.
