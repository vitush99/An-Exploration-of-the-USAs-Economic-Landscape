            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to demystify complex economic indicators—such as household income, employment rates, and GDP per capita—through engaging visualizations and interactive tools.

                The United States is a vast and diverse country, with each state contributing uniquely to the overall economic picture. By combining data with dynamic visualizations, this project offers an intuitive way to explore how these indicators vary across states and over time. Whether you're curious about income disparities, unemployment trends, or the economic growth of individual states, this explorable explanation will guide you through the data in a way that's both accessible and insightful.

                Through a series of interactive diagrams, you'll be able to:

                Compare household income levels across family types.
                Analyze unemployment and employment trends through color-coded maps.
                Investigate GDP per capita across states and how it has changed over the years.

        Household median income is very different, depending on the household type and reflecting a larger socio-economic dynamic within the United States. In general, a family household with a married couple at its head consistently shows the highest median income levels. Much of this likely comes from a dual-income advantage. By contrast, single-income households-most especially those maintained by a single female or male householder with no spouse-present notably lower medians. Such a wide gap in income between family and non-family households indicates the economic struggle of single-parent families due to various systemic factors, including the pay gap between genders and the limited availability of affordable childcare.

Non-family households, therefore, including those maintained by a single individual, also have significantly lower median incomes compared to family households. These figures point toward the economic vulnerability of individuals living alone or without familial supporting structures. Furthermore, when viewed across years-2022 and 2023-any observed change in median income across these categories could reflect broader economic trends such as inflation, wage growth, or post-pandemic recovery. For example, even the minor increase in incomes for most types may point to an incremental economic increase, although the continuing dispersion among household types indicates persisting structural inequity.

In all, this visualization shows that understanding household composition is crucial for analyzing income inequality. As such, targeted policy interventions are warranted to support single-parent families and reduce wage disparities in order to decrease economic inequities and promote financial resiliency among all household types.

            There is a clear relationship between median income and age, reflecting the life cycle of an individual's career. Income increases through early adulthood and peaks during the 35-54 age range before starting to decline. This happens to correspond with what is traditionally considered the prime working years-the period when workers gain experience, often complete higher education or specialized skill training, and advance in their careers. Skilled professional capital will have built up over time, and the possibility of higher earnings is realized more in these middle parts of life.

On the other hand, the 15-24 age bracket has the smallest median income. This difference is explained by the high number of part-time and entry-level jobs in this age category because many are still in school or just starting their work careers. Paralleling that, the decrease in median income across the age 65-and-over group represents their movement into the retired stage of life when they would be dependent mostly on fixed incomes, like pensions or Social Security, rather than active wages.

The income plateau and subsequent decline beyond age 55 give rise to important considerations of economic security in older age. This finding underlines the importance of ample retirement savings and social support to ensure economic security in later life. It also may be informative to compare the 2022 and 2023 age-income distributions for evidence of how economic conditions-including inflation and/or labor market changes-affect different age groups over time.

This figure displays the interactions between age, career trajectory, and financial planning as a frame for considering life-span implications of economic inequality.

        <h2>Unemployment Rates Across the United States</h2>
        <p>
            Let us take a look at the United States map and explore each state!
        </p>
        <div id="legend" style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: white; border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 200px;"></div>

        <p>
            This heat map shows the distribution of unemployment rates across the United States and thus provides a geographic lens into the disparities in economic fortunes. Darker shades represent states that have higher unemployment rates, while lighter shades show states that have relatively lower rates. The scale of unemployment rates-from a low of 2.0% to well over 5.3%-indicates great variability in local economic conditions, labor market dynamics, and policy impacts.

The lowest unemployment rates are in the Midwest and Mountain West states, such as Nebraska and Utah, which often reflect a mix of diversified economies and lower population densities. In contrast, the highest unemployment rates are found in states of the South and parts of the West Coast, which may reflect structural challenges such as industry-specific job losses, higher cost of living pressures, or restricted access to employment opportunities in rural or economically depressed areas.

This also brings out the contribution of regional policies and industries to employment. For example, states that depend on tourism or oil production face fluctuations in demand and exogenous shocks. Further, variations among neighboring states also indicate that local governance, educational systems, and infrastructure investments influence the characteristics of the labor market.

Further investigation into either trends over time or more detailed demographic and industry-specific unemployment data could help explain these patterns. As such, this map calls for action in the form of targeted economic interventions and workforce development programs to address regional disparities and create more equitable opportunities across the nation.

            This visualization presents the absolute numbers of employment throughout the United States, in a way giving an overview of workforce distribution by state. States with larger populations, like California, Texas, and New York, naturally show higher employment numbers, reflecting their large contribution to the national economy. Less populous states, like those in the Midwest and Mountain West regions, show lower absolute employment figures, consistent with their smaller labor forces.

The geographic distribution of the numbers of employment also underlines the economic weight of the urban and industrial centers. Large metropolitan states, such as Illinois with Chicago and Florida with Miami, tend to cluster in the higher ranges of employment, underlining the role of urbanization in creating jobs. These figures do not reflect employment quality, such as wage levels or job stability, which may vary widely within and across states.

When juxtaposed against the unemployment rate map, some interesting patterns emerge. Highly employed states, such as California, may still have a high unemployment rate, which would indicate labor supply and demand mismatches or regional job accessibility issues. On the other hand, states with low unemployment rates and lower employment numbers, such as Nebraska or South Dakota, reflect tight labor markets in smaller economies. These relationships underline the complexity in labor dynamics, where employment volume does not always guarantee low unemployment.

Together, these visualizations paint a detailed picture of the U.S. labor market, showing both its absolute workforce strength and unemployment challenges. They underscore the tailored economic strategies needed to address regional disparities, support job creation, and ensure equal access to available opportunities across the country.

        This series chart plots the GDP trajectories of various U.S. states over time against one another to show economic growth patterns and variability across states. Larger states like California, Texas, and New York obviously dominate this chart, reflecting their large contributions to the overall economy. Their steady rise shows how broad and extensive industries drive economic output at the state level.

        The visualization also captures periods of economic fluctuation, including the slowdown of 2008 during the financial crisis when so many states saw their economies stagnate or dip. The post-crisis recoveries are observed, resuming upward growth trends across different states at different rates. Some states with a more diversified industrial base generally perform in a much steadier manner, whereas some relying on specific sectors—energy or manufacturing, for instance—are more volatile.

        This chart shows the dynamic state economies and their ability to adapt to changing national and global conditions through an examination of GDP across time. It serves as a foundation for deeper analyses of regional economic strengths and vulnerabilities.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This interactive explanation of economic indicators throughout the United States has brought to light the complex nature of dynamics that shape the national economic landscape. From household median income to unemployment rates, employment numbers, and state GDP trends, each visualization sheds light on a different component of the factors that contribute to inequality in the economy.

            These differences in income across household types and age brackets highlight how systemic issues, such as family structure, gender roles, and career progression, all play a role in affecting financial stability. Simultaneously, the unemployment and employment maps show striking regional disparities, with some states thriving while others are unable to create sustainable jobs. The GDP trajectories over time further emphasize how economic growth is not uniform, with diversified-industry states outpacing those reliant on singular sectors.
            
            Put together, these findings underscore the interrelatedness of economic inequality: No single cause stands alone. Solving these problems will require multiple solutions, from wage equality to access to education, workforce development, and targeted economic policies that meet the unique needs of different regions and populations.
            
            This project is a diagnosis and a call to action. By visualizing these patterns, we seek to spur comprehension and meaningful conversations about how a more equitable and resilient economy is created. The data tells the story of progress and persistence of challenges that remind us that bridging economic divides is not solely a policy issue but is a shared effort at the societal level.
